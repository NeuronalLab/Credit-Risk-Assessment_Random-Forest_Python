In this video we explore the robust capabilities of Random Forest algorithms in assessing credit risk. We navigate through a dataset of 1,000 bank customers, analyzing loan repayment patterns to build a Machine Learning model to classify potential loan requests, distinguishing between good and bad customers with remarkable accuracy.
